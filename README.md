DarkPP (Dark++)
===========

A framework for building or extending decentralized DarkNet services.

Dark++ is a DarkNet, a term originally coined in the 1970s to designate networks which were isolated from ARPANET(which evolved into the Internet) for security purposes, darknets were able to receive data from ARPANET but had addresses which did not appear in the network lists and would not answer pings or other inquiries.
